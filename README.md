This C program offers multiple operations for managing a doubly linked list. You can start by filling the list with initial values to work with. The program allows you to add a value either at the beginning or the end of the list, ensuring flexibility in how you modify the structure.

You can also remove values from both the head or the tail, giving you control over the data. If you need to find a specific value, the search functionality makes it easy to locate elements within the list. Once modified, you can display the list either in its normal order or reversed, giving you different perspectives of the data. The program also includes an option to exit when you're done.
